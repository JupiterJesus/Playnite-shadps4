# Playnite-shadps4
Custom emulator configuration for shadPS4

Place files in %APPDATA%\Local\Playnite\Emulation\Emulators\shadPS4 (windows) or the linux equivalent. Configure as per RPCS3.

The default profile uses the SDL-only (no GUI) executable version. Since I wanted to have both the GUI and non-GUI version installed simultaneously, I downloaded the SDL-only version and renamed it to shadPS4-console.exe and placed it in the same directory as shadPS4.exe. This is what the Default included Profile assumes. If you don't want to do that, or if you want to use the GUI version, use the Default qt6 profile.
